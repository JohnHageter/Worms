## Setup
Install the necessary software to run the program to control the camera. Since these cameras are old and no longer supported, we need to install two things. One of which provides the necessary drivers for me to be able to "see" the camera and the other one is a programming interface which allows me to control the camera with python rather than c++ (which makes it easier on me).

ids-imaging.org  go to software & documentation:  
    - Install ids software suite ==4.97 (500M)
